1. What is React.js?
    React.js (commonly called React) is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications (SPAs). Developed and maintained by Facebook (now Meta), React was first released in 2013 and has since become one of the most popular frontend libraries.

  Note: What do we mean library?
    A library in software development is a collection of pre-written code, functions, classes, or modules that developers can reuse to perform common tasks without writing everything from scratch.
   

2. Core Characteristics:
   a. Component-Based Architecture: UI is broken into reusable, self-contained components

   b. Declarative Programming: You describe what the UI should look like for each state. 

   c. Virtual DOM: Efficient updates to the real DOM through a lightweight in-memory representation

   d. Unidirectional Data Flow: Data flows in one direction (parent to child components)

   e. JSX Syntax: JavaScript + XML syntax that gets transpiled to JavaScript 

 

3. Why Use React.js?
Key Advantages:
   a. Performance: Virtual DOM minimizes direct DOM manipulation for better performance 

   b. Reusability: Components can be reused across the application or in different projects 

   c. Large Ecosystem: Rich set of tools, libraries, and community support 

   d. SEO Friendly: Can be rendered on the server with frameworks like Next.js 

   e. Flexibility: Can be incrementally adopted and works well with other libraries/frameworks

   f. Strong Community: Backed by Meta and used by companies like Netflix, Airbnb, and Uber

4. When to Use React:
   a. Building dynamic, interactive user interfaces

   b. Creating single-page applications (SPAs)

   c. Developing cross-platform apps (with React Native)

   d. When component reusability is important

   e. Projects requiring frequent UI updates

5. How to Use React.js:
   5.1 Create React App (CRA) 
      npx create-react-app Project_name

   5.2 Vite (modern alternative to CRA)
      npm create vite@latest Project_name
